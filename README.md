# OCI-Architect-Pro
This is terraform code that tries - wherever possible - to automate - that is - use terraform code
for lectures given in OCI architect course for Exam 1Z0-997-23:
Oracle Cloud Infrastructure 2023 Architect Professional
Course is located here: https://mylearn.oracle.com/ou/course/oracle-cloud-infrastructure-architect-professional/122659/
Go step by step adding resources as necessary.

This is my own effort, not official documentation or guide, use it at your own risk
I highly encourage you to read readme files for every folder as there are manual steps
that cannot be automated.
Also, read comments in .tf files before executing them. I'm trying to explain my decisions
and show step by step progress along with unexpected discrepancies between videos,
docs and real executable terraform code.

Pay attention to variables.tf files for every 'root' folder that has main.tf files
those variables.tf MUST have your valid information to be able to connect to OCI
I will leave some sample values there to show how values should look like.

My idea is to have a working solution that you can just run using 'terraform apply'
but, again, some manual steps are required as stated in readme.md files for every chapter.

I'm currently going through this course, so it is my work in progress, 
I will be adding code for chapters over time, 
however I cannot guarantee any deadlines or promise anything
as I'm doing it on my free time.

Feel free to ask questions, post comments and suggestions; any fact-based criticism
is highly appreciated and welcomed.
